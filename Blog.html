          <h2>About My Internship</h2>
          <p>
            I joined Ecobees as a web development intern in 2025. It’s a great
            opportunity to learn and explore how companies work in real
            environments. The team is friendly and supportive, which makes the
            experience more valuable.

          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <p>
            Although I haven’t worked on any major projects yet, I have learned
            how to use HTML properly, especially with semantic tags. I also
            became familiar with the workflow of a tech team and how to
            communicate in a professional setting.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            My internship at Ecobees has just begun, but I am excited to grow
            and contribute as I learn more. I look forward to getting involved
            in upcoming tasks and gaining more experience.
